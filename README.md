## ✨ About Me
I’m a 27-year-old **self-taught coder** with over **6 years of experience** learning and experimenting with **Lua**, **C#**, and **HTML/CSS** outside of schooling.  
My journey started as a hobby, scripting and building projects on Roblox and tinkering with small game prototypes.  
Now, as a **Game Development student** at Full Sail University, I’m focused on learning new skills and turning my passion for software development/game development into a career.

- 🎓 **Student** at Full Sail University — Game Development Program  
- 🪖 **Veteran** of the U.S. Air Force with a **Network Management** background  
- 💻 Passionate about **software development**, **game design**, and **Roblox scripting**  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Vulkan API**, **C++**, **Lua**, and **MIPS Assembly**  
- 🐾 Just a silly puppy with big dreams in tech and game dev~
